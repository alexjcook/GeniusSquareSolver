## What is The Genius Square?

It's a fun board game, you should buy a copy!


## How is it played?
7 dice are rolled, which each correspond to a location on the board. A 'blocker' piece is placed on the board for each location. The player then has to fit all the remaining coloured play pieces onto the board.


## What is the purpose of this project?
This is a small project to teach myself Python. The program will roll the dice, place blockers on the board, and then attempt to find possible solutions using a recursive algorithm. The solved board is displayed with Matplotlib, together with a line plot of the number of solutions found vs time taken.


## How do I use this project?
This is a barebones Python script because I haven't learnt anything about packaging! You'll need Python, along with Numpy and Matplotlib.
You might like to change the SOLUTION_LIMIT constant which limits the number of solutions found.
