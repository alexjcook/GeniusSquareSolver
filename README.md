## How is it played?
Seven dice are rolled, each face corresponding to a location on the board. A 'blocker' piece is placed at each location. The player then has to fill the remaining spaces on the board with the coloured play pieces! Players can play solo or take on an opponent head-to-head.


## What is the purpose of this project?
This is a small project to teach myself Python. The program will roll the dice, place blockers on the board, and then attempt to find possible solutions using a recursive algorithm. The solved board is displayed with Matplotlib, together with a line plot of the number of solutions found vs time taken.


## How do I use this project?
This is a barebones Python script because I haven't learnt anything about packaging! You'll need Python, along with Numpy and Matplotlib.
You might like to change the SOLUTION_LIMIT constant which limits the number of solutions found.
